# singocalypse
In the aftermath of the coronavirus in 2020, a new apocalypse was born, the singocalypse - the apocalypse of single people!! Join Vincent and Jenny in their quest to save the world!

In Chinese, the slang for a single person is "单身狗" (Dānshēn gǒu), literally "single dog", and the slang for PDA (Public Display of Affection) is "撒狗粮" (Sā gǒu liáng), literally "spread dog food".

This is a shooter game where we play as a couple and shoot dog food at people, zombiefied by the single virus, to cure them of their disease.

No offense to anyone is meant by this game! I just thought the slang was funny and decided to base the game off of the joke.
